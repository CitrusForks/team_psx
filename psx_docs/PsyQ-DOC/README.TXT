Important Notes on using the CD Catalog and Acrobat 3.0	                12/12/96
====================================================================================


Using this Catalog
------------------
The Technical Reference CD has been designed to work with Acrobat Reader 
version 3.0.  Many of the features of this CD will not operate properly under
Reader version 2.1.


If you are a Win 95 User
------------------------
A Win 95 executable version of the Reader is installed on the CD in the 
Docsys/32bit directory. This Reader autoruns when you insert the 
Technical Reference CD into your CD-ROM drive.

Note that in order to search the CD, you must first do one of the following:

1: Click the "Load All Indexes" button of the Catalog cover (Catalog.pdf). By doing
this, you will cause all the available search indexes to be loaded into the Reader. 

2: Alternatively, you can click the "Select Index" button on the Catalog cover.
Use the Index Selection dialog to add each index on the CD that you want to search.
Each Technical Publications directory on the CD contains a related index (*.pdx).

If you are a Win 3.x User
-------------------------
A Win 3.x executable version of the Reader is installed on the CD in the
Docsys/16bit directory. If  you are running Win 3.x, then you 
must run this 16 bit Reader in order to view the CD contents. When you run
this version of the Reader, you must take one of the following steps to
load the Search indexes into the Reader:

1: Open Catalog.pdf on this CD and click the "Load All Indexes" button on the Catalog
cover. By doing this, you will cause all the available search indexes to be loaded into
the Reader. 

2: Alternatively, you can Open Catalog.pdf on this CD and then click the "Select Index" button on the Catalog cover. Use the Index Selection dialog to add each index on the CD that you want to search. Each Technical Publications directory on the CD contains a related index (*.pdx).


Important Acrobat Preferences
-----------------------------
Whether you install the Acrobat Reader locally or run the Reader from the CD,
the default preferences are set to display only one Acrobat document at a time in the
Reader window.This can be troublesome when you want to keep the CD Catalog open while
browsing documents you have accessed through the Catalog. 

To change this, simply choose File>Preferences>General in the Reader 
and deselect the option titled "Open cross-document links in same window".


Installing a Local Version of the Reader
----------------------------------------
For faster viewing of Acrobat documents, you may wish to install
Acrobat Reader 3.0 on your local hard drive. To do this, see the Readme
in the Viewers directory on this CD.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you install a local version of the Reader, then the
first time you use that Reader, no Search indexes may be loaded. To load the indexes,
see the instructions given above under "Win 95 User" and "Win 3.x User".
