DTL-H201 output plug-in module                                    version 1.2E


[ Operating environment ]

Adobe Photoshop 2.5, Windows 3.1, DTL-H201


[ Contents ]

TIMEXPE.8BE: Export module for the DTL-H201.  This allows you to create or edit
files in Photoshop, and output the image directly to the DTL-H201 (Artist Board)
for viewing on the screen.  Indexed color and RGB color files may be output.

TIMEXPE.TXT: This file.



[ Installation ]

Copy TIMEXPE.8BE into the "PLUGINS" sub-directory, found in the directory that
PHOTOSHP.EXE is located in.



[ Usage ]

Sending image data to the DTL-H201

1 Use ABORD.EXE to set the address of the DTL-H201.  
You can confirm the address in the About Box by choosing 
"Help / About plug-ins / TIM export..." from the menu bar.
(The default address is 0x1340)

2 Choose "File / Output plug-ins / TIM export" from the menu bar. 

3 The TIM Export Options dialog box is displayed.  The check boxes are set 
according to the results of the last time the module was used.

* Image data modes
Sets the pixel format to be used with the DTL-H201.
Choose one of the following settings according to the screen type: 
	Indexed color: 4 bit or 8 bit CLUT
	RGB color: 16 bit or 24 bit Direct

* Screen resolution
Sets the vertical (V) and horizontal (H) resolution of the DTL-H201.  
By changing the coordinate offset, you can display from any given address of VRAM.

* Display area
Sets the address in VRAM (from the upper left corner) and the width and height 
of the rectangle to be texture mapped.  This is ignored when in Load Only mode.

* Texture page
Sets the address in VRAM (from the upper left corner) and the width and height
of the texture data.  This is automatically set to (0, 0) when in Load Only mode.

* CLUT section
Sets the address in VRAM (from the upper left corner) of the CLUT.  
This is ignored when the image mode is set to 16 or 24 bit.

* Except black -> Translucent
In Photoshop format, sets the transparency control bit for pixels or CLUT 
entries other than those where the (R, G, B) values of the upper 5 bits are set 
to (0, 0, 0), and draws the polygons in the display area in translucent mode.  
As a result, all colors other than black become translucent.

* Black -> Transparent
In Photoshop format, clears the transparency control bit for pixels or CLUT 
entries where the (R, G, B) values of the upper 5 bits are set to (0, 0, 0).  
As a result, black becomes transparent, regardless of translucency mode.

* Load only
Sets the Load Only mode.  In this mode, texture data is only sent to VRAM, and 
mapping of the display area is not performed.  Transparency control bits are 
therefore ignored.  This mode is automatically selected when the color mode is 
set to 24 bits.

* Clear screen
All of VRAM is first cleared.

* Cancel
Cancels drawing.

* OK
Sends picture data to the DTL-H201.


******************************** IMPORTANT ************************************

* RGB components in Photoshop are used at a resolution of 8 bits each, but the 
DTL-H201 only uses 5 bits for each (except in 24 bit mode).  
Therefore, on output the lower 3 bits will be truncated.

* Transparency control bits are only valid in the display area where the texture 
mapping is drawn.

* The "Transparent" and "Translucent black/Opaque black" attributes in the TIM 
format are the same as those in the Photoshop format.  This is manipulated 
through the two check boxes found in this plug-in module which set the 
transparency control bit.  However, you cannot perform mapping in a single 
display area using both "Transparent" and "Translucent black/Opaque black" 
attributes at the same time.  For situations such as this, set all "black" 
pixels to an alternate value such as (R, G, B) = (0, 0, 1) in the TIM format.
