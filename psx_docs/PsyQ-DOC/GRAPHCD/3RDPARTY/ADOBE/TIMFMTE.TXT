[ Contents ]

TIMFMTE.8BI: TIM format module.  Allows importing files with a ".TIM" file 
extension.

TIMFMTE.TXT: This file.



[ Installation ]

Copy TIMFMTE.8BI into the "PLUGINS" sub-directory, found in the directory that 
PHOTOSHP.EXE is located in.



[ Usage ]

Opening TIM format files

To open TIM format files, choose "File / Open..." from the menu bar, and select 
a file with the ".TIM" extension.

Saving TIM format files

1 In the "Save" or "Save As..." dialog box, select "TIM (*.TIM)" from the 
"File Format" list.
           
2 Enter an appropriate file name, and click "OK".

3 The warning message "Some picture information cannot be saved" will be 
displayed.  Click "OK".

4 The TIM Format Output Options dialog box is displayed.  The texture CLUT 
address and texture page address from the last file opened  (or saved) 
remain saved.

* Image data modes
Sets the PMODE of the TIM format file.  
Set as follows according to the source image mode:
        Indexed color: 4 bit or 8 bit CLUT
        RGB color: 16 bit or 24 bit Direct

* CLUT section
Sets the address (from the upper left) of the CLUT in VRAM.
You may set the width (W) and height (H) as follows:
        4 bit CLUT: Width:  16 (fixed), Height: 1-16 (as need)
        8 bit CLUT: Width: 256 (fixed), Height: 1 (fixed)

* Pixel data section
Sets the address (from the upper left) of the pixel data in VRAM.  
The image width (W) and height (H) is displayed, but cannot be changed.

* Except black -> Translucent
In conversion to TIM format, sets the transparency control bit for pixels or 
CLUT entries other than those where the (R, G, B) values are set to (0, 0, 0). 
As a result, these become translucent only in translucent mode.
(This check box is unchecked by default).
 
* Black -> Transparent
In conversion to TIM format, clears the transparency control bit for pixels or 
CLUT entries where the (R, G, B) values are set to (0, 0, 0).
As a result, black becomes transparent, regardless of translucency mode.
(This check box is checked by default).

* Cancel
Cancels the save operation.

* Default
Sets the standard addresses for the CLUT section and Pixel data section.
This operation cannot be undone.

* OK
Saves the image data as a TIM format file.


******************************** IMPORTANT ************************************

* The TIM format, except when in 24 bit mode, has a bit for transparency control, 
but this is not supported by Photoshop.  Therefore, when files are imported into 
Photoshop the transparency control bit is lost, and "Transparent" and "Translucent 
black/Opaque black" attributes become the same in the Photoshop format.  This is 
manipulated when saving through the two check boxes found in this plug-in module 
which set the transparency control bit.  However, you cannot save a single TIM 
file which uses both "Transparent" and "Translucent black/Opaque black" attributes 
at the same time.  For situations such as this, set all "black" pixels to an 
alternate value such as (R, G, B) = (0, 0, 1) in the TIM format.

* RGB components in Photoshop are used at a resolution of 8 bits each, but the 
TIM format only uses 5 bits for each (except in 24 bit mode).  Therefore, when 
a TIM format file is opened, 0s will be inserted into the lower 3 bits, and 
when the file is saved only the upper 5 bits are retained.

* Photoshop's indexed color images use a 256-entry CLUT, so even for 4-bit CLUT 
TIM files up to 256 colors may be maintained.  However, when the image is 
displayed in Photoshop only the first 16 CLUT will be used.
