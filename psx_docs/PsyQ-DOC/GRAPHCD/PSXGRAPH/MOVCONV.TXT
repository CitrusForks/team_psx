==========  Movie Tool  ==========

[ Movie Tool ]        < MovConv > 
       
MovConv is a movie data converter for PlayStation.        
It accepts movie data input in a variety of formats such as        
Video For Windows avi, and converts them to movies for         
use with the PlayStation.  For a detailed description of this        
tool, please see the online help available after bringing up         
the MovConv "help" menu.       
 
	*  Batch Processing Function (From ver.1.95)    
    
A function has been added to sequentially process the examples         
described in the script file (batch file).        

Refer to the file [your parent directory]\psxgraph\bin\sample.scr  
for script description methods and functions used in the current version.       

 < MovPack >     
   
MovPack is a tool for interleaving streaming data created with         
MovConv together with XA-ADPCM data for use in multi-channel         
streaming.


[ Movie Tool Installation ]   
     
"MovConv" can be installed either by the Setup Tool on the 
Programmer Tools CD or the Graphic Artist Tools CD.  Place the CDROM
in the drive, and double-click on the icon in [cdrom]:\setup\setup.exe.
When Setup provides you a list of components to install, be sure that
the  "Executables and compilers" component has a check mark next to it.

Alternatively, you can do the following:              

1. Start Windows and open File Manager.               
2. Copy gauge.vbx and threed.vbx to the Windows 3.1 system                    
   directory (c:\windows\system, etc.).                 
3. Drag the copied movconv.exe and movpack.exe to File                    
   Manager and drop them in the appropriate group in Program Manager.
   (*.vbx, *.exe and *.hlp are in \psxgraph\bin.)        

This completes installation.

[ HOW TO USE ]        
Refer to online help for each tool.  However , 
"movconv.hlp" is  slightly obsolete; here's an update:

	=== New features which are not described in the help file ===

	[ Script ]
	MovConv has a batch processing cabability.  A script defines the processing
	sequence.  The script for MovConv is very simple.  It is a sequence of
	functions which defines each conversion.  See \psxgraph\bin\sample.scr to
	check the syntax of the MovConv script. 


	[ Q matrix ]
	The "Q matrix" is a quantization matrix which is used in the quantization stage of
	MDEC compression.  The MDEC quantization stage is the same as a JPEG or MPEG
	quantization stage.  (Please refer to other documentation about this for
	more details).  Normally, you don't need to change the  Q matrix value.  
	If you are very familiar with JPEG or MPEG compression, you can change the Q matrix
	value to optimize compression.

	[ Leap sector ]
	A "leap sector" is a sector which is put on output data to syncronize video
	with audio.  To be exact,  the NTSC video frame rate is not 60.00 fps but
	59.94 fps.  If you import video using video capture equipment, the base
	frame rate of imported video is 59.94 fps.  But the PlayStation streaming
	mechanism expects video data to be 60.00fps.  So, if you play this video
	data with PlayStaion, it is played slightly faster than it should be.
	Usually, it doesn't matter while you play only video data because the frame
	rate difference is very small.  But if you play audio data with video
	data, you will recognize that synchronization of video and audio gradually becomes
	incorrect .  You can solve this problem by putting a leap sector on the 
	original 59.94fps video.  This makes 59.94 fps video 60.00 fps.

	Please refer below to see whether you should or should not put in a leap sector.
