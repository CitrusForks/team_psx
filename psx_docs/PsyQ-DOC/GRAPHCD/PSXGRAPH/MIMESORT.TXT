Name 
====
mimesort - Sorts vertex information in the TMD file.  This enables the
application of a smaller-sized difference file for MIMe after mimefilt,
contributing to the high-speed movement of MIMe animations. 

Date 
====
July 19, 1995, Version 1.3e

Syntax 
======
mimesort [options] [base-model.tmd model1.tmd [model2.tmd [model3.tmd ...]]] 

Explanation 
===========
Vertex information in the TMD file is sorted to enable the application of a
smaller-sized difference file for MIMe created by mimefilt.  The run time
needed for MIMe animations can be calculated in a shorter period. 

mimesort changes the order of vertex information.  This requires that all
files to be applied to mimefilt be applied to mimesort.  If only part of
the files have been applied to mimesort, vertices become out of sync
between TMD files, making it impossible to create a correct difference
file. 

A wild card can be used as an argument. 

Up to 32 variation model files (TMD files other than base-model) can be
specified.  If the number of variation model files exceeds 14, however, the
specified models from the 15th onward are not used for sorting.  As only
the first 14 models are used as information for sorting, vertex information
is rearranged on the models from the 15th onward.  In other words, the
variation model files from the 15th onward may possibly be made inefficient
during output.  
(See remarks to obtain as good results as possible.) 

[Options] 

[-d directory] 

Specifies an output directory for saving a sorted TMD files.
The default is "..\STMD".  An output directory must have been created.

[-v] 

A set of vertices before and after sorting can be standard-output so that
the sorting process may be checked.  If this option has not been specified,
no information is output.  
The following gives the meaning of output. 

file:  (vertex: a/b) 
	file:  File name 
	a:  Number of vertices included in a difference file 
	b:  Total number of vertices 

.....*****++*+++++++++*****.............
	. : Vertex not included in a difference file as there is no difference 
	+ : Vertex included in a difference file although there is no difference
	* : Vertex included in a difference file as there is difference 

[-stdin] 

Loads a model file name from the standard input.  Entering only a line feed
results in the termination of loading. 

Example 1:  Manual file name input 

C:\> mimesort -stdin 
Source model:  md1.tmd[RET]   <- Enter the source model file name. 
Variation model #1: md2.tmd[RET]   <- Enter the file name of variation model 1. 
Variation model #2: md3.tmd[RET]   <- Enter the file name of variation model 2. 
Variation model #3: [RET]   <- End of input 
(Omitted) 

Example 2:  Automatic input.  The -v option is also used. 

C:\> type list 
md1.tmd 
md2.tmd 
md3.tmd 
                   <- The end blank line is required. 

C:\> mimesort -stdin -v < list > output
(Omitted) 

Supplementary information 
=========================
The sorting of data (including normal data) other than vertex data is not
supported. 

A difference file is not always made to be smaller-sized.  
Effect can be checked by means of vertex information output by the -v
option.  Applying data before and after mimesort to mimefilt to compare the
size of difference files allows the identification of more efficient data. 

A TMD file to be entered must be able to be applied to mimefilt. 
Furthermore, mimesort cannot be applied to a TMD file containing two or
more objects. 

A wild card can be used as the file name.  The start item must be the base
file, however.  Should a variation model file be developed at the position
of the source model file, the desired result of sorting cannot be acquired.
 Check the message output during execution, "base files=", to make sure
that the wild card is developed as expected. 

Even though a sub-directory has been specified in a file for the source
model or a variation model, a file is created right under the output
directory.  Thus, the file with the same name in a different directory must
not be specified for input. 

The current directory must not be specified as the output directory.  If
the current directory has been specified, the input file is overwritten and
destroyed by the output file. 

Note that the MS-DOS command line incurs restriction on the number of
characters. 

Remarks 
=======
[Notes on handling more than 14 variation model files] 

The use of MIMe for key frame animations where key frames for models are
arranged in time series may often result in an enormous number of MIMe
parameters.  The concurrent application of too many parameters to a model
consumes much time and memory, however.  The replacement of the base model
for key frame animations at places where only few key frames are correlated
with one another leads to efficiency enhancement. 

Should more than 14 variation model files be specified, the files from the
15th onward are not used as sorting information, with only vertex order
rearranged according to the result of sorting the first 14 files.  (This is
because integrity for mimefilt is maintained.)  Therefore, the following
files should be specified as the files from the 15th onward. 


o  Files for which less effects of sorting are expected 

If nearly all vertices are moved, sorting effects are lowered. 


o  There is another same file (under the standpoint of vertex movement). 

If original vertexs provides the following results as viewed in -v, file2
is not distinguished from file3 in the point of vertex movement.  If file2
has been specified in any of the first 14 files, therefore, file3 may be
specified in any of the subsequent files. 

file1:  *++***... 
file2:  ..**++*.. 
file3:  ..**++*.. 
file4:  ....**+** 

file20: ..*****.. 


o  Low importance 

Files seldom used, or not subjected to high temporal restriction 


Restrictions
===============
Version 1.0 
	Can only sort vertex data. 
	There is only one type of sorting algorithm. 
	There is a maximum of 15 files consisting of 
        base*1 + variant*14 that can be handled. 





Changes
=======
Changes in version 1.1 

Bugs on handling the TMD file having a large primitive section have been
corrected. 

Also for 15 to 32 variation model files, vertices are rearranged. 

Changes in version 1.2 

The -stdin option enables the standard input of a model file name. 

Changes in version 1.3 

The bug that a primitive other than triangle polygons cannot be handled
properly has been corrected.
