   This version has been changed so that it can output VAG data offset tables for the basic sound library(libspu).  VAG data offset tables are output as
a series of C unsigned longs, for inclusion directly in source code.

   Use the -v option when outputting a VAG data offset table (.h) and the -h
   option when a VAB header file (.vh) must be output.
   
   EXAMPLE:
   
   > vabsplit -v -h wavedat1.vab wavedata2.vab
   

<VABSPLIT>

   VABSPLIT is a program which splits PlayStation sound source data into a
VAB file attributes table header (VABheader, .vh) and a waveform data body
(VABbody, .vb).
   
   The VABheader needs to be resident in main memory while that bank is being 
   used,but VAB body can be deleted from main memory if transfer completion
   is confirmed.  
   
   Splitting the header and body makes it possible to use libsnd's 
   SsVabOpenHead(), SsVabTransBody(), and SsVabTransCompleted() functions to
   recognize VAB, and check on transfer start and transfer completion.

   Usage:

        VABSPLIT <vab1> <vab2> ....
