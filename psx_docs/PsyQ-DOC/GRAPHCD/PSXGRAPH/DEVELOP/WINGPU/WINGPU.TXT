PlayStation libgpu for Windows		(Version 1.0)    July 19, 1996

1.  	Outline
This is a dynamic link library used to access the PlayStation artist board
from Windows applications.

This version corresponds to Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5.

2.  	ligpu
Although most functions are common with ligpu version 3.5 programmer tools,
there are several differences:
* 	Kanji fonts cannot be used.
* 	The structure size is different.
* 	Use structure OT with the ordering table.
* 	The VSync return value has no meaning.
* 	An artist board port address setting function (SetPortId) and
        connection detection function (AssertAboard) have been added.

3.  	libetc
The function by which the PlayStation controller emulates on the PC
keyboard is provided in libetc.lib. This libetc differs from libetc in
the programmer tools on the following points.

* 	The allocation and call-back related functions cannot be used.
* 	The meaning of the PadInit arguments is different.
 When an argument has been specified as 1, it will initialize at the default key assign.
 (The default contents are entered at the end of libetc.h)
 Any values other than this will not be allocated a key.
* 	To use PadRead messages must be processed by means of PadReadProc.
* 	An artist board port address get function (GetPortId) has been added.

Furthermore, this library is not always essential in order to
access the artist board.

4.  	Essential files
 libgpu.dll:	DLL
 libgpu.lib	libgpu.dll import library
 libetc.lib		Static library (large model) of Pad-related function 
 definitions
 libgte.h		Essential for structure definition.
                        This must be included
 before libgpu.h.
 libgpu.h		libgpu header file
 libetc.h		libetc header file

5.  	Installation method

	libgpu.dll
		Copy to Windows system directory.
	libgpu.h
	libgte.h
	libetc.h
		Include in the compiler include path.
	libgpu.lib
	libetc.lib
		Place in the appropriate directory and link with the
                main program.

When using DLL, specify the artist board port address beforehand
using the artist tool aboard.exe.  It will then be possible to
obtain the port address with the GetPortId( ) function of libetc.lib.

6.  	Sample Program
The PlayStation sample program has been ported to a Windows program
for the artist board.

Compile each Visual C++ 1.51 as a large model or a huge model and
link with libgpu.lib or libetc.lib.

* 	winballs
winballs.c
balltex.h
winballs,def
winballs.exe

The number of balls can be increased or decreased with the 'E', 'C',
'up arrow' or 'down arrow' keys.

The 'G' or 'Esc' keys are used to terminate.

* 	wintuto0
wintuto0.c
mat0tex.c
mat1tex.c
mat2tex.c
mat3tex.c
wintuto0.exe

The character to the left is moved up, down, right or left using
the 'E', 'S', 'C', 'F', 'up arrow', 'left arrow', 'down arrow',
and 'right arrow' keys, and the character to the right is moved up,
down, right or left with the 'I', 'J', 'M', or 'L' keys.
The 'R' and 'U' keys enlarge or reduce both characters.
The 'G' or 'Esc' key is used to terminate.
