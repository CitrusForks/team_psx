	timutil - convert each bit map format of the TIM, BMP, PICT, RGB
		to one of them.

DATE

SYNOPSIS
	timutil

DESCRIPTION
	TIM utility is a Windows application which allows you to convert
	each bit map format on the PlayStation TIM, Windows BMP, Macintosh
	PICT, and general-purpose RGB to one of them.  Works on
	PC/AT compatibles under Windows 3.1 

	See on-line help for more details.

	[options]

	none

NOTES
	The timutil uses the SPIN.VBX. Install the SPIN.VBX into the
	\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

	The compressed format BMP, JPEG compressed PICT, 32-bit PICT and
	PICT without bit map cannot be read-in.

	Write-out as the compressed format BMP or JPEG compressed format PICT
	file is not allowed.
	Write-out file bit depth is limited to 4, 8, 16 or 24-bit.

	In data conversion in which the bit depth reduces, for example, from
	16-bit to 8-bit, color information is approximated.
	As this approximation is not realized with a method such as color
	compression but with color map on which R, G and B are uniformly
	allocated, the color accuracy may deteriorate.

	As a rule, overwriting to the file which was read in is not allowed.
	However, overwriting is allowed when both read-in format and
	write-out format are TIM and only image origin and pallet origin were
	changed.
	This function is equal to TIMPOS.EXE of Commandline version.

Changes in Ver 1.10

	Now, a TIM file can be displayed on Artist Board(DTL-H200)
	by selecting [TIM view...].
	(This command is equivalent to timview.exe on the command line.)

	The function of timpos.exe has been incorporated into [Convert...].

	[Save all...] has been added to the file menu.

Changes in Ver 1.15

	You can use a program called "aboard.exe" to change an I/O address to
	communicate with Artist Board(DTL-H200).

	[Preferences...] has been added to the file menu. This command changes
	default values of conversion.

Changes in Ver 1.20

	[Pallette to use] list has been added to the [Parameter setting window]
	to support "multi-CLUT" TIM files.

Changes in Ver 1.30

	[TIM layout...] has been added to the window menu.

Changes in Ver 1.35

	Modification has been made to display the area 480 in height (double
	the area 240 in height) considering the double buffer even if the
	height of the display area is 240 in the [TIM layout] dialog box.

	Debugging has been made to normally display the TIM file whose
	[Image org] is off the texture page boundary in the [TIM view].

	Modification has been made to open a RSD file. The system operates
	as if all the TIM files included in the RSD file were opened.

	Modification has been made so that Drag & Drop from the file manager
	or opening a file from the file opened prior to the file menu can
	change the current directory. This change has allowed the directory
	of the last opened file to become the current directory.
	(In the previous version, the current directory was changed only when
	the file dialog box was used, that is a file was opened using the
	[Open...] file menu or the directory was changed using the
	[Save all...] menu.)

	Debugging has been made so that the check of data overwrite to the
	same file is made for a change to [Palette to use].

Changes in Ver 1.36

	A bug has been fixed that a BMP file using fewer colors than
	calculated by the bit depth cannnot be read in.
