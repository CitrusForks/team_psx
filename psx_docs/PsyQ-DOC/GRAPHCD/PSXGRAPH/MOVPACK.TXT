      o   Version 1.3e.
          Termination data can be specified for each channel.
          One can specify "No Data".  If the data to be interleaved
          is XA-ADPCM data and your program expects video data as 
          termination data, then one should specify "Video sector" 
          and its length.  If you need null sectors after channel
          data, you can specify "Null sector" and its length.  The 
          unit for length is 1 sector.
