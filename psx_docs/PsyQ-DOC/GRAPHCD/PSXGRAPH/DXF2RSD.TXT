NAME
        dxf2rsd - Converts DXF files to the PlayStation 3D model data file format.

DATE
        1996/May/01 Version 2.81

FORMAT
        dxf2rsd [options] DXF-files ...

DESCRIPTION
        A DXF filename is provided as an argument. The following four files are created.
                * RSD file (*.rsd)
                * polygon file (*.ply)
                * material file (*.mat)
                * group file (*.grp)

        The argument can contain wildcard identifiers. Multiple files can be given to 
        perform batch conversions. The ".dxf" extension in the filename can be omitted.

Changes in Ver 2.81
	 Memory related bug has been fixed.

	 New release of an SGI version. (See psxgraph/sgi)

        [options]

        -o output-file: Specifies the output RSD filename. Extensions will be removed.
                        The default is the filename of the input file without the 
                        extension.

        -col r g b:     Specifies the colors in the entire model as RGB (values of 0-255
                        for each). The default is gray (200 200 200).

        -cf color-file: Specifies the color table file.

        -cl:            Outputs a list of undefined colors to standard output. Polygons 
                        having the same color will be sorted and output to a MAT file. 
                        The default setting is OFF. (See Example 2.)

        -info:          Displays information regarding the input DXF file. Approximate size 
                        and polygon counts can be viewed. Conversion is not performed.

        -max n-poly:    Specifies the maximum polygon count that can be converted. The 
                        default setting is 10000.

        -quad:          Triangulation is not performed for 4-vertex 3DFACE. Combined with 
                        -quad1, it is possible to decrease the total polygon count in a 
                        model. The default setting is OFF.

        -quad2 (threshold): Combines two adjacent triangles into one four-sided polygon. If 
                        an argument is specified, the difference in orientations of two         
                        triangles (normal vectors) can be specified as an angle, and         
                        triangles for which the angle is not more than this value are 
                        combined. When the argument is 0.0, triangles are combined only if 
                        they have identical normal vectors. When the argument is 10.0, 
                        differences of up to 10 degrees are allowed. Decimal numbers between 
                        0.0 and 90.0 should be specified. The default setting is 1.0. (See 
                        Example 4.)

         -quad3:        Four-sided polygons having identical third and fourth vertices are 
                        generated from triangles. This allows all polygons to be four-sided 
                        polygons.

         -s or -g:      Performs smooth (Gouraud) shading. The default setting is OFF.

         -e distance:   All vertices existing within a sphere having a radius specified by 
                        the distance argument are considered identical. This allows the 
                        vertex count and the polygon count to be decreased. The calculation 
                        of distance is performed after scaling has been performed with -sc.

         -r:            The normal count is decreased by not generating identical normal 
                        vectors. This is effective for cases involving flat shading. The 
                        default setting is OFF. (See Example 3.)

        -n:             Normals are not created. This option is used when light source 
                        calculations are not performed. The default setting is OFF.

        -sc factor:     Reduces or enlarges the model. The scale is indicated by the 
                        argument. The default setting is 1.0.

        -t  x y z:      Translates the model. The translation is specified by the argument. 
                        The default is (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).

        -auto:          Translates the model near the origin and enlarges or reduces the 
                        model to an appropriate size (so that it fits in a cube having a 
                        side 1000). The default setting is OFF.

        -back:          Reverses the direction of the normals for all the polygons. The 
                        default setting is OFF.

        -both:          Creates all polygons as two-sided polygons. The default setting is 
                        OFF.

        -dup:           Polygons are created on both the front and back of all the polygons. 
                        The polygon count is doubled. The default setting is OFF.

        -nopl:          Ignores POLYLINE and converts only 3DFACEs. The default setting is 
                        OFF.

        -Y-Z      
        -Y+Z
        +Y-Z
        +Y+Z
        -Z-Y
        -Z+Y
        +Z-Y
        +Z+Y
                        These settings specify the method used to convert the coordinate 
                        system. The settings specify the top coordinate axis and the axis 
                        coming forward and their orientations when the modeler's
                        coordinate system is looked at from the front. For example, "-Y+Z" 
                        indicates that the negative of the Y axis comes forward, and the 
                        positive of the Z axis goes up. The coordinate system here is
                        that of the DXF, and is not necessarily identical to that of the 
                        modeler screen. The default is "-Y+Z". In dxf2rsd, this is converted 
                        to the PlayStation coordinate system (-Z-Y). (In the PS coordinate 
                        system, the negative of the Z axis comes forward, and the negative 
                        of the Y axis goes up.)

        -v:             Detailed information regarding conversion is output to standard 
                        output. (See Example 1.)

Main improvements over the previous version (ver.2.7).

        * The -quad2 option is implemented. Two adjacent co-planar triangles are converted 
          to a four-sided polygon. The margin of error in conversion can also be specified.         
          This allows the total polygon count to be reduced. (See Example 4.)

        * Triangle and quadrilateral groups can be created and written as GRP files.

        * When the -cl option is specified, groups are created by color, and GRP files are 
          written.

Page 3

RESTRICTIONS: The current version has the restrictions shown below.

        * Only DXF files in ASCII format can be handled.

        * Of the DXF entities, only 3DFACE and POLYLINE can be handled.

        * In some cases, large POLYLINEs cannot be converted. If possible, DXF files should 
          be created by converting to 3DFACE (three-sided or quadrilaterals) from the 
          modeler.

        * If the four vertices in a quadrilateral are not co-planar, the polygon may not be 
          correctly displayed.

        * The maximum number of polygons that can be converted is influenced by the number 
          of vertices and normals to be generated. About 5000 polygons should be considered 
          the maximum.

NOTES

        * 3DFACE, POLYLINE are both formats for representing polygons in DXF. In 3DFACE, a
          single polygon (three-sided or four-sided) is represented with four vertices. In 
          POLYLINE, multiple polygons are represented through connected lines. 3DFACE files 
          tend to be larger but provide better compatibility. POLYLINE files tend to be 
          smaller, but there is greater freedom in expression so that exchanging data with 
          different modelers can be a problem.

          3DFACE can be converted directly to RSD, but triangulation must first be performed 
          for POLYLINE. This division is generally expensive, and can sometimes be 
          unsuccessful (a "Fail to triangulate!" error message will be displayed).         
          Furthermore, even if triangulation is completed successfully, the orientations of 
          some of the polygons may be reversed with POLYLINE.

          However, the POLYLINEs generated by 3D Studio are called POLYFACE MESH, and these 
          use a representation method that is equivalent to 3DFACE. Thus, there are no 
          problems in conversion for these cases.

        * On the console, the practical maximum limit for animating a single object is 
          approximately 2000 polygons. Model data should be prepared accordingly.

        * If the polygon count is too high for conversion using flat shading, it may be 
          possible to perform the conversion by specifying Gouraud shading.

        * The orientation of polygons will be reversed each time the Y-Z coordinate axes are 
          exchanged or when the sign of an axis is swapped.

        * With certain modelers the orientation of the polygons will be reversed even when a 
          3DFACE output is made. If all the polygons are reversed, the coordinate system can 
          be changed (+Y+Z, for example) or the -back option can be used. If only some of 
          the polygons are reversed, the reversed faces need to be reversed from the 
          modeler.

        * Below is a list of commercial 3D modelers for which conversion with dxf2rsd has 
          been checked.

          The options for converting coordinate systems are also noted.

           not needed)

          ShadeIII (1.0)                     Mac

          The necessary conditions for "convertability" are that DXFs of all the 3DFACEs can 
          be output  and that the orientation for polygons can be reversed individually. 
          Conversion can be possible even if these conditions are not met. It is also 
          possible to use another modeler to read a DXF file and save it, so that conversion 
          is possible for a file that cannot be directly converted.

        * If the data size is too large and not all the normals can be generated, the -n 
          option will assume that the normals have been generated and will create an RSD 
          without normals.

        * The -r option is not valid when Gouraud shading is performed. Also, since the -r 
          option changes the normal count and the ordering, it cannot be used when 
          performing a normal MIMe.

        * A Z sort may occur if -quad2 is used to combine two triangles into a 
          quadrilateral.

        * If two triangles to be combined in -quad2 were specified by the modeler to have 
          different colors in the DXF, it is possible to override -quad2 just for that 
          portion. When doing this, the -cl option should also be invoked, as in 
          dxf2rsd -quad2 -cl.

EXAMPLE 2: Using color data

        The color data used in the modeler can be reflected in the RSD. To do this, the -cl 
        option should be specified. Polygons will be colored "approximately". "Approximately" 
        means that the colors will be different from the modeler's, but portions that had the 
        same color will be assigned a single color. This is because DXF does not use RGB 
        values and instead only saves "color numbers". Colors can then be specified by editing 
        the MAT file using a text editor or by creating a color table file as described below.

        > dxf2rsd -cl foo > foo.cl <create a color table file>

        > type foo.cl   <creates a file containing color numbers>

          183
          40
          253
          0
          8

        A text editor is used to enter RGB values (0 - 255) following each of the color 
        numbers.

        > type foo.cl

	  183	100 100 200
	  40	 58  20  43
	  253	 10 100  10
	  0	212  20 100
	  8	  0 128 126

Page  6

        dxf2rsd is executed again using the -cf option.

        > dxf2rsd -cf foo.cl foo

        The newly created RSD will have colors assigned according to the color table file.


EXAMPLE 3: Converting large data files

        When a data file is too detailed, the -e option can be used to combine a number of 
        vertices into a single vertex. In the following example, two vertices that are         
        separated by a distance of 100 or less are considered identical. This results in 
        decreased vertex, polygon and normal counts (note that distances are calculated based 
        on the scale after scaling has been performed).

        While it depends on the data, an appropriate distance setting can generally reduce the 
        size of the data with almost no change in shape.

Furthermore, the normal count can be reduced by specifying the -r option.

Page  7

EXAMPLE 4: Combining into quadrilaterals

        By specifying the -quad2 option, two adjacent triangles can be combined into a single
        quadrilateral. In the following example, two triangles having an angle between them of 
        5 degrees or less are combined into four-side polygons. This results in the polygon         
        count reduced by almost a half.

        > dxf2rsd -v -quad2 5.0 earth

==================================================
  Input DXF file: earth.dxf

	RANGE  x:   -4.000 ...   +3.986
	       y:   -3.997 ...   +3.997
	       z:   -4.000 ...   +4.000
	MATERIAL:    0

  [RSD] VERTEX  : 2231
        POLYGON : 1686               <- 2502 triangles were combined
                  triangles  :  43      to form 1251 quadrilaterals.
                  quadrangles: 1251     1686 polygons total.
	MATERIAL:    0
	NORMAL  : 1686 (quad2 < 4.9870)

  Output files  : earth.[rsd, ply, mat, grp]


	NORMAL  : 1686 (quad2 < 4.9870)

        In the above, the "4.9870" indicates the largest angle out of the maximum angle (in 
        this case 5.0) that was actually converted. Thus, executing the command again with a 
        "-quad2 4.986" option would further reduce the number of combined quadrilaterals 
        somewhat.
