
psxcons.exe is a console program for DEX2000(DTL-H2000).

Before running the program, make sure DEVICE=ANSI.SYS is specified in
the config.sys file.

At present, psxcons.exe starts with the default board I/O address as 0x1340 
and 10 as the IRQ.

To modify these, specify the address and interrupt with option -p0x as 
follows.
        c:>  psxcons -p0x320,10

Or, start the program after setting the environment variable DEX2000 as 
follows.
        set DEX2000=0x320,10

psxcons.exe cannot coexist with dexbios.com, so delete dexbios.com first from
resident memory before starting the program.

If resetps 2 is run before the program is started, or if F7 2 RET F9 F10 is pressed after the program has started, control transfers to an internal ROM
debugger.

Once the program is running, pressing the F1 key will bring up some simple
help.

If you can remember how to use the keys F2, F3,and F4, you should easily be 
able to use this program.  Please refer to the manual for details. 
(psxcons.dvi can be printed out with print.man).
