RULE 1: Do not talk about the style guide

RULE 2: Do NOT talk about the style guide

RULE 3: Module Declarations
  S1:   Each module shall be lower case, with underscores ("_")
        between words in multiword names
  S2:   Each input/inout/output shall begin on the line following
        the module name
  S3:   Each module will have inputs listed before inouts and 
        inouts before outputs
  S4:   Inputs/inouts/outputs shall have their type and widths
        declared inside the module parens
  S5:   All input/inout/outputs shall be lower case with
        underscores ("_") between words in multiword lines if
        the line does not connect directly to an FPGA pin
  S6:   For input/inout/outputs that connect directly to an
        FPGA pin, the name shall be all caps and descriptive
        to the pin to be connected (even if the pin goes through
        one or more higher level modules)

RULE 4: Parameters
  S1:   Parameters shall be declared immedately after module
        declarations and shall be all caps
  S2:   Start of parameters shall be commented as such:
        /* Parameters */

RULE 5: Signal Lines
  S1:   Signal lines shall follow the convension for input/inout/
        outputs that are not connected to FPGA pins
  S2:   All signal lines shall be declared after parameters.
  S3:   State of signal lines shall be commented as such:
        /* Internal Lines */

RULE 6: always_comb blocks
  S1:   All always_comb blocks shall have a comment above them
        indicating the purpose of the logic
  S2:   All always_comb blocks shall have default values given
        for ALL signal lines set within them at the begining of
        the block. This shall be commented:
        /* Defaults */

RULE 7: always_ff blocks
  S1:   All always_ff blocks shall have a comment above them
        indicating what is stored
  S2:   rst lines are asserted HIGH
  S3:   All always_ff blocks must have a special case for 
        asynchronous reset which does not include any synchronous
        conditions

RULE 8: FSMs
  S1:   All states declared in an enum shall have names formatted
        in all caps
  S2:   The state register shall always load the next state if no
        reset is asserted

RULE 9: Reset
  S1:  System asynchronous reset shall have the name rst and shall
       be asserted HIGH
  S2:  All modules with sequential circuitry must take in system
       reset

RULE 10: Clocks
  S1:  System clock shall have the name clk
  S2:  All sequential elements shall change on the posedge unless
       other reasons require negedge
  S3:  All other clocks shall have have the name clk_freq where
       freq is the frequency of that clock, unless the clock is
       an external signal in which case it shall follow the naming
       convention for external connections

RULE 11: begin..end
  S1:  All always blocks (always_ff, always_comb, always) shall
       have begin..end surrounding their content
  S2:  All if statements shall have begin..end surrounding their
       content
  S3:  All cases in case statements shall have begin..end
       surrounding their contents
  S4:  begin shall appear on the same line as the statement it
       surrounds
  S5:  end shall apear on its own line

RULE 12: Other Style Guidelines
  S1:  Lines shall not exceed 100 character in length
  S2:  Lines should be maximum of 80 characters in length
  S3:  Values shall always have width (though some widths may be
       the empty width)
