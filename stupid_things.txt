STUPID THINGS
-------------
A grand list of errors and issues we ran into that didn't have a 
clear solution.

- When using debug cores in vivado, make sure the path to the project is not 
  too long. When running 'Implement Design' the process will error @ opt_design

- sudo everything

- When using quartus, DON'T create bidirectional logic anywhere but the top
  module. DON'T propagate inouts through modules, keep them only in the top.

- Even if you put something in always_ff, Quartus will complain and infer
  latches if you don't assign the WHOLE signal in more than one place.

  Example of what will infer latches:
  always_ff @(posedge clk, posedge rst)
      if (rst)
          cop2 <= 'd0;
      else
          cop2[0] <= nxt_cop[0];

  Example of what will NOT infer latches:
  always_ff @(posedge clk, posedge rst)
      if (rst)
          cop2 <= 'd0;
      else
          cop2 <= nxt_cop;

- Synthesis is DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB. And (System)Verilog is DUMB DUMB DUMB.
  If you go back past commit bead0e745d2dc24d9375e5658d40f8097c91b0f4 and
  look at dma.sv, the bit will not get set in DICR even though both
  conditions are met.
  Things Anita changed in an attempt to fix it (and they work too): 
    - Changed always to always_ff
    - Changed else with and if inside to else if
    - Changed reg to logic (but that didn't do anything on it's own)
  Things that don't work for no clear reason:
    - The bit in DICR got synthesized out in an assign, but not in
      always_comb. NO CLEAR REASON WHY!
