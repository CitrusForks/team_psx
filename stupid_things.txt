STUPID THINGS
-------------
A grand list of errors and issues we ran into that didn't have a 
clear solution.

- When using debug cores in vivado, make sure the path to the project is not 
too long. When running 'Implement Design' the process will error at opt_design

- sudo everything

- When using quartus, DON'T create bidirectional logic anywhere but the top
module. DON'T propagate inouts through modules, keep them only in the top.

- Even if you put something in always_ff, Quartus will complain and infer
latches if you don't assign the WHOLE signal in more than one place.

Example of what will infer latches:

always_ff @(posedge clk, posedge rst)
    if (rst)
        cop2 <= 'd0;
    else
        cop2[0] <= nxt_cop[0];

Example of what will NOT infer latches:

always_ff @(posedge clk, posedge rst)
    if (rst)
        cop2 <= 'd0;
    else
        cop2 <= nxt_cop;
