STUPID THINGS
-------------
A grand list of errors and issues we ran into that didn't have a 
clear solution.

- When using debug cores in vivado, make sure the path to the project is not 
too long. When running 'Implement Design' the process will error at opt_design

- sudo everything

- When using quartus, DON'T create bidirectional logic anywhere but the top
module. DON'T propagate inouts through modules, keep them only in the top.
